**Quantum Fog Legacy History**

This GitHub project is intended to be loosely based on a Mac application called Quantum Fog (referred to as QFogL henceforth. L for legacy). 

QFogL was written by R.R.Tucci. Tucci received very valuable assistance from uber programmer David Phillip Oster, who ported QFogL from Classic to Mach-O.

QFogL is written in C++.

QFogL depends on a C++ class library called PowerPlant that implemented beautifully and effortlessly the Mac GUI of those times. PowerPlant can be found at SourceForge (http://open-powerplant.sourceforge.net/), but, alas, it has not been updated to run on the current Macs. 

QFogL vers.2.0 (last legacy version) was compiled on Sept. 11, 2006, with CodeWarrior Vers.10.0, the last version of a compiler/IDE made by Metrowerks Inc., a company that no longer exists. 

QFogL vers. 2.0 has been tested on an eMac with PowerPC chip (G4-1.25GHz) running MacOS 10.4.11.

QFogL vers.1.6 was the last version compiled for the Classic Mac OS. QFogL vers 2.0 can run under Mac OS X for PowerPC chips, as it is a Mach-O application, but it cannot run on Intel chips (unless you use some kind of PowerPC emulator on an Intel Mac).

The source code for QFogL vers.2.0 is included in the `Legacy` folder of this GitHub quantum-fog repository. Additional information and downloadable files related to QFogL can be found at www.ar-tiste.com/qfog.html
