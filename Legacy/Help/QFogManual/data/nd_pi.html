<P>
This window allows you to define, view, and modify the transition matrix
associated with each node of the graph.
<P>
At any given time, the window refers to only one node, the one whose name
appears in red. We'll call it the <I>focus node</I>. You may change the focus
node by either of 3 methods:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Clicking on the <B>First</B> and <B>Next</B> buttons located to the right
    of the red name.
  <LI>
    Selecting a different node from the popup menu located to the right of the
    red name.
  <LI>
    Double clicking on the node's icon in the <B>Main Window</B>. (When the Palette
    is closed, this always works. But when the <B>Palette</B> is open, you must
    first select the <B>Open</B> tool of the <B>Palette</B> before double clicking
    the node.)
</UL>
<P>
  <HR>
<P>
<H3>Focus Node Field </H3>
<P>
This field gives the name of the focus node in red. The field can be edited
directly by the user. If you enter into this field a node name that is longer
than the box surrounding the field, the name will scroll automatically to
show the last character typed. This scrolling may hide some of the first
characters of the node name. Use the left-arrow key to move the insertion-point
cursor (a blinking vertical line, like the letter "I") to the left, the
right-arrow key to move it to the right, the up-arrow or HOME key to move
it to the beginning of the node name, the down-arrow or END key to move it
to the end of the node name.
<P>
Besides appearing in this window, in red, the name of the focus node also
appears in the <B>Main Window</B>, directly beneath the icon of the focus
node. One can edit this name either where it appears in the <B>Node
Prior-Info.</B> window, or where it appears in the <B>Main Window</B>. Changing
one occurrence will automatically change the other.
<P>

<P>
<H3>Parent Nodes Table</H3>
<P>
The box entitled "Parent Nodes" contains a table that specifies one of the
possible input states of the focus node. None of the cells of this table
can be edited directly by the user. However, the input state can be varied
by using the <B>First</B> and <B>Next</B> buttons to the right of the table
or by using the popups in each row of the table.
<P>
  <HR>
<P>
<H3>Amplitudes Table</H3>
<P>
The box entitled "Amplitudes" contains a table that displays the transition
amplitudes of the focus node when the input state is the one given in the
Parent Nodes box.
<P>
The second column of the table lists the names of all the states of the focus
node. These names can be edited directly by the user.
<P>
The first column tells which states are active. Active states are indicated
by a star (*) and inactive ones by a blank. Clicking on a cell of the first
column will toggle the cell's contents between blank and star.
<P>
The last two columns of the table give the complex amplitudes of the states.
These amplitudes can be edited directly by the user. Alternatively, one can
edit them with either the <B>Generate Amplitudes...</B> button or the
<B>Import/Amplitudes...</B> menu item. (The <B>Generate Amplitudes...</B>
button is discussed below. The <B>Import/Amplitudes...</B> menu item is discussed
in the section entitled "Import".)
<P>
Let [C1,C2] be the set of all cells contained within a rectangle with cells
C1 and C2 as opposite (top-left and bottom-right) corners. Let U be the set
of all cells in the second, third and fourth columns. To select more than
one cell, you will need to use the SHIFT key. You can select any subset [C1,C2]
of U in one of 2 ways.
<P>
If
<UL>
  <LI>
    while holding the SHIFT key down, you press the mouse button down on the
    cell which you intend to be the initial anchor of your selection, and
  <LI>
    you release the SHIFT key if you wish to do so, and
  <LI>
    while holding the mouse button down, you drag the cursor to the cell which
    you intend to be the final anchor of your selection, and
  <LI>
    you release the mouse button,
</UL>
<P>
then all cells in set [initial anchor, final anchor] will be selected.
<P>
Alternatively, if
<UL>
  <LI>
    you click on the cell which you intend to be the initial anchor of your
    selection, and
  <LI>
    you release the SHIFT key if you wish to do so, and
  <LI>
    while holding the SHIFT key down, you click the mouse button on the cell
    that you intend to be your final anchor cell,
</UL>
<P>
then all cells in set [initial anchor, final anchor] will be selected.

<H3>Number Of Rows...</H3>
<P>
Pressing the <B>Number of Rows...</B> button opens the <B>Number Of Rows</B>
window. This window allows you to change the number of rows of the Amplitudes
Table. See the section entitled "Number Of Rows".
<P>
  <HR>
<P>
<H3>Generate State Names...</H3>
<P>
Pressing the <B>Generate State Names... </B>button opens the <B>Generate
State Names </B>window. This window generates new names for the states of
the focus node. These names appear on the second column of the Amplitudes
Table. See the section entitled "Generate State Names".
<P>
  <HR>
<P>
<H3>Total Probability = </H3>
<P>
Let R be the number of rows of the Amplitudes Table, and let Z<SUB>1</SUB>,
Z<SUB>2</SUB>, ...Z<SUB>R</SUB> be the complex amplitudes given by that table.
<P>
Pressing this button calculates Pr = |Z<SUB>1</SUB>|<SUP>2</SUP> +
|Z<SUB>2</SUB>|<SUP>2</SUP> +... |Z<SUB>R</SUB>|<SUP>2</SUP>,
<P>
and displays it to the right of the button.
<P>
If Quantum Fog is not certain that the value being displayed for Pr is
up-to-date, it will erase the value and show a blank. Better to display nothing
than to display an erroneous value. If no value for Pr is currently showing
and you wish to see one, just press the <B>Total Probability</B> button.
Quantum Fog will then re-calculate Pr and post it.
<P>
Pr will usually be very close to one. After all, it represents the probability
that any state of the focus node will occur when the input state is as given.
However, one can construct nets (see the section entitled "Parameters Of
Beam-Splitter" for an example) that will always give correct physical predictions
even though some of their Pr's are not one. (By physical predictions we mean
the information contained in the <B>Node Probs.</B>, <B>Bi-node Probs.</B>
and <B>Stories</B> windows).
<P>
  <HR>
<P>
<H3>Generate Amplitudes...</H3>
<P>
The effect of pressing the <B>Generate Amplitudes...</B> button depends on
the node-type of the focus node.
<P>
If the focus node is a Custom node, nothing happens.
<P>
If the focus node is of type T, where T=
<UL>
  <LI>
    Beam-Splitter or
  <LI>
    Deterministic Node, or
  <LI>
    Polarization Rotator or
  <LI>
    Polarizer or
  <LI>
    Qbit Rotator or
  <LI>
    Stern-Gerlach Magnet,
</UL>
<P>
then a window entitled "Parameters Of T" appears.
<P>
These windows allow you to specify certain parameters which depend on the
node-type, parameters which are sufficient to specify a transition matrix
for the focus node. Upon dismissing these windows with an <B>OK</B>, the
computer changes the transition matrix stored in memory for the focus node.
