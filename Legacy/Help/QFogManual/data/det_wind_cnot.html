  Parameters Of Controlled-Not

<P>
When you press the <B>OK</B> button in this window, the computer checks that
<UL>
  <LI>
    the focus node has precisely two parents,
  <LI>
    each parent has precisely 2 states, 0 and 1, in that order.
</UL>
<P>
If these conditions are satisfied, the above window closes. Furthermore,
the states and amplitudes stored in memory for the focus node are changed.
If the conditions are not satisfied, the above window remains open, the states
and amplitudes are not changed, and a warning message appears on the screen.
<P>

<P>
Consider, for example, what will happen if the above window is closed with
the above settings:
<P>
Suppose M<SUB>1</SUB>, M<SUB>2</SUB>, N<SUB>1</SUB>, N<SUB>2</SUB> are elements
of {0,1}. The Parent Nodes table<B> </B>of the <B>Node Prior-Info</B> window
will display the two parent nodes in a certain order. Say M<SUB>1</SUB> is
the state of the first parent P<SUB>1</SUB>, and M<SUB>2</SUB> is the state
of the second parent P<SUB>2</SUB>. Define (N<SUB>1</SUB>, N<SUB>2</SUB>)
in terms of M<SUB>1</SUB> and M<SUB>2</SUB> as follows.
<TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING="2">
  <TR>
    <TD>M<SUB>1</SUB></TD>
    <TD>M<SUB>2</SUB></TD>
    <TD>(N<SUB>1</SUB>,N<SUB>2</SUB>)</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>0</TD>
    <TD>0</TD>
    <TD>(0,0)</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>0</TD>
    <TD>1</TD>
    <TD>(0,1)</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>1</TD>
    <TD>0</TD>
    <TD>(1,1)</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>1</TD>
    <TD>1</TD>
    <TD>(1,0)</TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
This table may be described by saying that
<UL>
  <LI>
    N<SUB>1</SUB> = M<SUB>1</SUB> &nbsp;and M<SUB>2</SUB> is transformed into
    N<SUB>2</SUB> ,
  <LI>
    P<SUB>1</SUB> (the "control" bit) causes P<SUB>2</SUB> (the "target" bit)
    to flip (i.e., to change from 0 to 1 or vice versa) whenever M<SUB>1</SUB>
    is 1, and
  <LI>
    P<SUB>1</SUB> has no effect on P<SUB>2</SUB> whenever M<SUB>1</SUB> is 0.
</UL>
<P>
Quantum Fog gives names N<SUB>1</SUB>N<SUB>2</SUB> (i.e., 00, 01, 10 and
11) to the states of the Controlled-Not. When the states M<SUB>1</SUB> and
M<SUB>2</SUB> are given by a particular row of the above table, Quantum Fog
assigns unit amplitude to the state N<SUB>1</SUB>N<SUB>2</SUB> shown in that
row, and it assigns zero amplitude to all the other states.
