This window displays the joint probability distribution of the bi-node whose
name appears on the face of the window's popup. The window displays this
distribution for the latest e-case analyzed by the computer.
<P>
The popup of this window lists only those bi-nodes that were listed earlier
in the <B>Bi-nodes Of Interest</B> window.
<P>
For the bi-node selected in the popup and for the latest e-case,
<UL>
  <LI>
    The left margin of the table lists the states of the first node of the bi-node,
  <LI>
    The top margin of the table lists the states of the second node of the bi-node,
  <LI>
    The table itself lists the probability of each pair of node states.
  <LI>
    The small caption labeled <B>Info</B> gives the Shannon Information for
    the displayed probability distribution.
