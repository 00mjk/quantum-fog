This command opens the following window: <BR>

Pressing the <B>Choose Folder</B> button opens a Mac "folder-chooser" window&mdash;a
window that allows you to choose&nbsp;an already existing folder. Let's call
the folder that you choose the <I>designated folder</I>. Your designated
folder will store TEXT files used by Quantum Fog. Once the folder-chooser
window is dismissed with an OK, the path to the designated folder will appear
to the right of the <B>Choose Folder</B> button.
<P>
To the right of the word <B>Prefix</B>, is a text box. You should enter into
it a string. This string will be used as a prefix to the name of all TEXT
files requested in the bottom part of the <B>Text Files Used During Run
</B>window.
<P>
The bottom part of the <B>Text Files Used During Run </B>window allows you
request files you want Quantum Fog to read or write. You request a file
by&nbsp;putting a check mark (by clicking the box) in front of the file's
name.
<P>
If you press the <B>OK</B> button of the <B>Text Files Used During Run
</B>window, then, when you press <B>Go Forward</B>, the computer will
<UL>
  <LI>
    READ information from <CODE>&lt;prefix&gt;Ecases.txt</CODE>, if that file
    was requested, and if Quantum Fog finds a file with that name in the designated
    folder,
  <LI>
    create a file named <CODE>&lt;prefix&gt;NodeProbs.txt</CODE> (ditto,
    <CODE>&lt;prefix&gt;BinodeProbs.txt</CODE>,
    <CODE>&lt;prefix&gt;Stories.txt</CODE>) located in the designated folder,
    and then WRITE information in the file, if that file was requested.
</UL>
<P>
Pressing <B>Go Forward</B>, with the
&nbsp;<CODE>&lt;prefix&gt;NodeProbs.txt</CODE> option on, will OVERWRITE
any files named <CODE>&lt;prefix&gt;NodeProbs.txt</CODE> that are stored
in the designated folder. If you do not wish this to happen, before you press
<B>Go Forward</B>, move such a file to another folder. The same warning about
over-writing applies for the
&nbsp;<CODE>&lt;prefix&gt;BinodeProbs.txt</CODE> and
<CODE>&lt;prefix&gt;Stories.txt </CODE>options.
<P>
As its name implies, the <CODE>&lt;prefix&gt;Ecases.txt</CODE> file should
contain a list of e-cases. See the section entitled "How To Write An E-Cases
File".
<P>
The computer will write into the
<CODE>&lt;prefix&gt;NodeProbs.txt</CODE> file the probability distribution
for every node of the graph. (Actually, if no nodes are selected, it will
write the probability distribution for every node of the graph. However,
if some nodes are selected, then it will write the probability distribution
only for those nodes that are selected. This feature is convenient when you
want the file to show information for just a few, not all, of the nodes.)
<P>
The computer will write into the <CODE>&lt;prefix&gt;BinodeProb.txt </CODE>file
the probability distribution of those bi-nodes which you specified earlier
in the <B>Bi-nodes Of Interest</B> window.
<P>
The computer will write into the <CODE>&lt;prefix&gt;Stories.txt</CODE> file
a list of all the possible stories. The stories are listed in groups such
that all members of a group have that same ending. The file gives for each
story:
<UL>
  <LI>
    its complex amplitude
  <LI>
    the state assigned by the story to each node of the graph.
