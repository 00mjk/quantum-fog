  Generate State Names

<P>
This window opens if you press the <B>Generate State Names...</B> button
of the <B>Node Prior-Info.</B> window. You can always enter manually (or
import, or cut and paste) the state names of the focus node of the <B>Node
Prior-Info.</B> window. This window gives you yet another option. It will
instruct the computer to generate certain kinds of name sequences automatically.
This is especially useful when the focus node has a large number of states
and you wish to label them by an increasing sequence.
<P>
Think of each name as a vector with N components. All names generated will
have the same number of components N. You enter N into the field labeled
<B>Number Of Components =.</B> Each component can only be a single alpha-numeric
character&mdash;that is, either a letter from a,b, ...,z or an integer from 0,1
, ...9. Assume that alpha-numeric characters form an increasing sequence:
0, 1, 2, ..., 8, 9, a, b, ..., y, z. Suppose C<SUB>min </SUB>and
C<SUB>max</SUB> are two elements of the sequence such that C<SUB>min</SUB>
is less than C<SUB>max</SUB>. You can specify C<SUB>min</SUB> in the field
labeled <B>Smallest=</B>, and C<SUB>max</SUB> in the field labeled
<B>Largest=</B>. Let S[C<SUB>min</SUB>,C<SUB>max</SUB>] be the set of all
alpha-numerics greater or equal to C<SUB>min</SUB> and smaller or equal to
C<SUB>max</SUB>. The computer will list all the N component vectors such
that every component belongs to S[C<SUB>min</SUB>,C<SUB>max</SUB>]. If you
put a check mark in the <B>Use commas and parentheses</B> box, then adjacent
components of the vector will be separated by commas and a parenthesis will
precede the first component and follow the last one.
<P>
For example,
<UL>
  <LI>
    If N = 3, C<SUB>min</SUB> = 0 , C<SUB>max</SUB> = 9, and Commas=No, the computer
    will list the 1000 decimal&nbsp;numbers 000, 001, 002, ..., 999.
  <LI>
    If N = 5, C<SUB>min</SUB> = 0, C<SUB>max</SUB> = 1, and Commas=No, the computer
    will list the 32 binary numbers 00000, 00001, 00010,..., 11111.
  <LI>
    If N = 5, C<SUB>min</SUB> = 0 , C<SUB>max</SUB> = 1, and Commas=Yes, the
    computer will list the 32 binary numbers (0,0,0,0,0), (0,0,0,0,1),
    (0,0,0,1,0),..., (1,1,1,1,1).
  <LI>
    If N = 3, C<SUB>min</SUB> = x , C<SUB>max</SUB> = z, and Commas=No, the computer
    will list the labels xxx, xxy, xxz, xyx, xyy, ..., zzz
  <LI>
    If N = 3, C<SUB>min</SUB> = 8 , C<SUB>max</SUB> = b, and Commas=No, the computer
    will list the labels 888, 889, 88a, 88b, 898, 899, 89a, 89b, 8a8,..., bbb.
</UL>
<P>
This window will NOT override the number of states, call it D, that has been
specified in the <B>Number of Rows</B> window. If the parameters that you
specify imply a sequence of names that is longer than D, then only the first
D terms of the sequence will be used. Conversely, if the sequence is shorter
than D, then all the terms of the sequence will be used. Those states not
covered by the sequence will retain the names they had immediately before
you summoned the above window.
<P>
When you dismiss the above window by pressing <B>OK</B>, the state names
of the focus node become those specified by the window.
<P>
When you dismiss the above window by pressing <B>Cancel</B>, the state names
of the focus node remain the same as they were immediately before you summoned
the window.
