  Dialog Windows For Specific Node-Types
</H1>
<P>
Suppose that&nbsp;the focus node of the <B>Node Prior-Info.</B> window is
of a certain type X, and that this node satisfies certain minimum conditions
that all type X nodes must satisfy. Then pressing the <B>Generate
Amplitudes...</B> button of the <B>Node Prior-Info.</B> window will open
a dialog window which depends on the node type X. This dialog window will
allow you to specify certain parameters that completely characterize type
X nodes. Such dialog windows are entitled ``Parameters of X". In the next
few sections, we will discuss all ``Parameters of X" windows. We will discuss
them separately for each X. But first, let us discuss some traits common
among them.
<P>
All ``Parameters of X" windows contain an <B>OK</B> and a <B>Cancel </B>button.
<P>
When you dismiss such a window by pressing <B>OK</B>, the computer changes
the transition matrix and states stored in memory for the focus node so that
they are consistent with the parameters that you've specified.
<P>
When you dismiss such a window by pressing <B>Cancel</B>, the computer does
not change the transition matrix or the states of the focus node. They remain
the same as they were immediately before you pressed the <B>Generate
Amplitudes...</B> button.
<P>
For some X's, type X nodes have photons as inputs and outputs. For such nodes,
it is convenient to make the following definitions:
<DL>
  <DT>
    <I>scalar-field node</I>&nbsp;
  <DD>
    A node with <I>scalar-field states</I>&nbsp; ; i.e., states named by non-negative
    integers. These integers refer to the number of particles (photons) in the
    state.
  <DT>
    <I>vector-field node</I>&nbsp;
  <DD>
    A node with <I>vector-field states</I>&nbsp; ; i.e., states named by pairs
    (N<SUB>x</SUB>, N<SUB>y</SUB>) of non-negative integers. The first component
    refers to the number of photons polarized in the X direction, and the second
    to the number of photons&nbsp;polarized in the Y direction. For example,
    (1,2) represents a state with 1 photon in the X and 2 in the Y.
