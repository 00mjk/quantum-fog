<P>
<UL>
  <LI>
    Select the <B>Open</B> icon of the <B>Palette</B>. Double click on the node
    called "2mag". The <B>Node Prior-Info.</B> window opens, showing information
    about node <I>2mag</I>&nbsp; . The node whose name appears in red is called
    the <I>focus node</I>&nbsp; of the <B>Node Prior-Info.</B> window. You may
    change the focus node by either of 3 methods:
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Clicking on the <B>First</B> and <B>Next</B> buttons located to the right
	of the red name.
      <LI>
	Selecting a different node from the popup menu that is located to the right
	of the red name.
      <LI>
	Double clicking on the node's icon in the <B>Main Window</B>. (When the Palette
	is closed, this always works. But when the <B>Palette</B> is open, you must
	first select the <B>Open</B> tool of the <B>Palette</B> before double clicking
	the node.)
    </UL>
  <LI>
    Choose <I>root</I>&nbsp; to be the focus node. Click on the <B>Number Of
    Rows...</B> button. Insert 3 for the number of rows and press <B>OK</B>.
    In the box labeled Amplitudes, in the column labeled State, change the 3
    current state names from x to: (0,0), (0,1) and (1,0).
  <LI>
    Repeat the last step, but this time for node <I>1mag</I>&nbsp;. Give it 3
    states called (0,0), (0,1) and (1,0).
  <LI>
    Repeat the last step, but this time for node <I>2mag</I>&nbsp;. Give it 3
    states called (0,0), (0,1) and (1,0).
  <LI>
    Repeat the last step, but this time for node <I>nz+</I>&nbsp;. Give it 2
    states called 0 and 1.
  <LI>
    Repeat the last step, but this time for node <I>nz-</I>&nbsp;. Give it 2
    states called 0 and 1.
  <LI>
    Repeat the last step, but this time for node <I>nu+</I>&nbsp;. Give it 2
    states called 0 and 1.
  <LI>
    Repeat the last step, but this time for node <I>nu-</I>&nbsp; . Give it 2
    states called 0 and 1.
