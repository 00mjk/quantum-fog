<P>
With Quantum Fog, you can have several <B>Main Window</B>s open at the same
time, each displaying a different net.
<P>
For each <B>Main Window</B> that is open, you can open additional
<I>satellite</I>&nbsp;windows. A satellite window (like, for example, the
<B>Node Prior-Info.</B> window) shows data that pertains to the <B>Main
Window</B> that owns it.
<P>
A <B>Main Window</B> together with its satellite windows is called a
<I>project</I>. A project is given the same name as its <B>Main Window</B>.
<P>
All projects use the same <B>Palette</B>. One can therefore think of the
<B>Palette</B> as being JOINTLY owned by all projects. 
<P>
Occasionally, you may want two satellite windows of the same type but belonging
to different projects to be open at the same time. For example, you could
open two <B>Main Window</B>s called "QFog-1" and "QFog-2", and then you could
open the <B>Node Prior-Info.</B> window for QFog-1 and the <B>Node
Prior-Info.</B> window for QFog-2. To prevent confusion in such situations,
satellite windows exhibit a small caption with the word "Project:", followed
by the name of their project. For example, the <B>Node Prior-Info.</B> window
for QFog-1 exhibits the caption: "Project: QFog-1".
<P>
The project that owns the currently active window is called the <I>active
project</I>.
<P>
If you select the <B>Active Project</B> item of the <B>Windows</B> menu,
you get a list of all currently <U>open</U> projects. The name of the currently
<U>active</U> project is preceded by a check mark. If, in this list, you
select the name of any project, that project becomes the active project and
its <B>Main Window</B> is selected.
<P>
In the <B>Windows </B>menu, all menu items except the first 3 (<B>Active
Project:, Open Main Window</B>, and <B>Open Palette)</B>, refer to satellite
windows owned by the <U>active</U> project. 
<UL>
  <LI>
    If satellite window W of active project X is closed, its name in the
    <B>Windows</B> menu is prefaced by the word "Open". Choosing menu item <B>Open
    W</B> opens W of project X.
  <LI>
    If satellite window W of active project X is already open, its name in the
    <B>Windows</B> menu is prefaced by the word "SELECT". Choosing menu item
    <B>SELECT W</B> selects W of project X.
