All editable fields (i.e., rectangles in which you enter a single name or
number) allow you to select some (or all with <B>Select Al</B>l) of their
text and then <B>Cut</B>, <B>Copy</B> or <B>Delete</B> the selected text
(<B>Copy</B> = copy it onto the Clipboard , <B>Delete</B> = erase it,
<B>Cut</B> = <B>Copy</B>, then <B>Delete</B>). After using <B>Cut</B> or
<B>Copy</B>, you can use <B>Paste</B> to paste the Clipboard contents at
the current cursor position.
<P>
In addition, there are 2 other places where you can use <B>Cut</B>,
<B>Copy</B>, <B>Paste</B>, <B>Delete</B>, <B>Select All</B>.
<OL>
  <LI>
    In the <B>Main Window</B>, you can select some (or all with <B>Select All</B>)
    of the nodes and arrows of your net. (For more information about how to select
    items in the <B>Main Window</B>, look in the <B>Palette</B> section of this
    manual.) Then you can <B>Cut</B>, <B>Copy</B> or <B>Delete</B> the selection.
    <P>
    After using <B>Cut</B> or <B>Copy</B>, you can click on any <B>Main Window</B>
    at the position where you want the drawing to show up, and then press the
    <B>Paste</B> menu item. Besides the picture of each node, its transition
    matrix will also be pasted, if it makes sense to do so. You can paste from
    one <B>Main Window</B> to the same <B>Main Window</B> or to a different one
    (one belonging to a different project).
  <LI>
    In the Amplitudes Table of the <B>Node Prior-Info.</B> window, you can select
    a rectangular subset of the cells of the table. (For more information about
    how to select cells in the Amplitudes Table of the <B>Node Prior-Info.</B>
    window, look in the "Node Prior-Info." section of this manual.) Then you
    can <B>Cut</B>, <B>Copy</B> or <B>Delete</B> the selection.
    <P>
    After using <B>Cut</B> or <B>Copy</B>, you can click on any cell, call it
    the "click cell", of any Amplitudes Table, and then press the <B>Paste</B>
    menu item. The clipboard contents will be entered into the table and selected.
    The top-left corner cell of the selection will be the click cell. You can
    paste from an Amplitudes Table to the same Amplitudes Table or to a different
    one (one belonging to a different focus node or to a different project.)
    <P>
    You can also use <B>Cut</B>, <B>Copy</B> and <B>Paste</B> to transfer data
    between an Amplitudes Table and a table belonging to a spread-sheet program.
    <P>
    Importing Via Clipboard:&nbsp;You can select a rectangular set of cells from
    a&nbsp;spread-sheet table and copy it onto the clipboard. Then you can paste
    the contents of the clipboard onto an Amplitudes Table of a Quantum Fog project.
    Of course, Quantum Fog will refuse to paste the data if it is inadmissible.
    <P>
    Exporting Via Clipboard: You can select a rectangular set of cells from an
    Amplitudes Table of a Quantum Fog document and copy it onto the clipboard.
    Then you can paste the contents of the clipboard onto a spread-sheet document
    (or even onto a TEXT document).
    <P>
    (When exporting and importing via the Clipboard, Quantum Fog puts into the
    clipboard a string of characters in TEXT format. Within this string, new
    columns are indicated by a TAB, and new rows by a RETURN. All the elements
    of the first row are listed, then those of the second row, and so on.)
    <P>
    If no cell or one cell of the Amplitudes Table is selected, then pressing
    <B>Select All</B> will select all the contents of the cell that contains
    the blinking cursor. If two or more cells of the Amplitudes Table are selected,
    then pressing <B>Select All</B> will select all the selectable cells of the
    table (i.e., all cells in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th columns of the table). Thus,
    to use <B>Select All</B> to select all the selectable cells of the table,
    you must: (1)select at least 2 cells of the table, (2) press <B>Select All</B>.
</OL>
<P>
At all times, the DELETE keyboard key and the <B>Delete</B> menu item produce
identical results.
