<BR>
If this option is turned ON (indicated by a check mark in front of the item),
the computer will store in memory all the possible stories for the last e-case
it considers. If after pressing <B>Go Forward</B> in the <B>Go</B> menu,
you press <B>Open Stories</B> in the <B>Windows</B> menu, you will be able
to see a picture of each of the possible stories.
<P>
If this option is turned OFF (no check mark), the computer will at no time
save in memory the full set of stories of any e-case it considers. Instead,
at any given time, the computer will have only one story stored in memory.
Since the set of stories is not stored, the <B>Open Stories</B> item of the
<B>Windows</B> menu is disabled in this case.
<P>
You should not confuse the <B>Illustrate Stories</B> command with the command
to write the stories into a file (see <B>TEXT Files Used During Run...</B>
command ). The first of these commands writes the stories to memory, the
second to a file in your hard disk. You may run Quantum Fog with just one
of these options ON, or with both ON, or both OFF.
<P>
The ON mode of the <B>Illustrate Stories</B> command allows one to study
all the possible stories by viewing them on the <B>Main Window</B>. However,
one pays for this luxury by having to use a lot of memory to store the stories.
Thus, the ON mode is recommended only if the net being considered does not
have a large number of stories.
<P>
The OFF mode of the <B>Illustrate Stories</B> command does NOT allow one
to study the possible stories by viewing them on the <B>Main Window</B>.
(One can still study them, but not graphically. One can ask Quantum Fog to
write the stories into a file, and study them there). The OFF mode uses less
memory than the ON one. Thus, the OFF mode is recommended if the net being
considered has such a large number of stories that pressing <B>Go Forward</B>
in the ON mode causes the computer to run out of memory.
