<IMG BORDER="0" SRC="drum.gif" ><B>Quantum Fog does NOT spend any memory
in saving transition amplitudes that equal zero. (By a zero amplitude we
really mean one whose magnitude is smaller than 10<SUP>-12</SUP>). Thus,
a 1000 &#215; 2000 transition matrix (for a node with 1000 states and 2000
input states) with a single non-zero entry occupies the same amount of memory
as a 1 &#215; 1 non-zero transition matrix.</B>
<P>
It is possible to encounter situations in which the transition matrix of
a node has so many columns or rows that there isn't enough memory to store
it. If only a minority of the entries of such a matrix have a large magnitude,
and the rest have a small one, one may wish to filter out those entries that
have a small magnitude; that is, to replace them by zero so as to save memory.
<P>
Define GAP to be the smallest |A|, where A ranges over all <I>non-zero</I>
node amplitudes of every node of the graph. When you choose <B>Prune Node
Amplitudes...</B> from the <B>Prepare</B> menu, Quantum Fog first calculates
GAP. It then opens the following window:

<P>
This window displays the current value of GAP (rounded to the nearest power
of ten). Suppose you enter a number N in the shaded box to the right of the
words "I wish gap to be". If next you press the <B>OK</B> button, Quantum
Fog replaces by zero any amplitude whose magnitude is smaller than
10<SUP>-N</SUP>. Obviously, this has no effect if 10<SUP>-N</SUP> is smaller
than the initial GAP. This operation CAN'T BE UNDONE, so you better save
a duplicate copy of your file before trying this.<BR CLEAR="all">
