<P>
<UL>
  <LI>
    In the <B>Node Prior-Info.</B> window, make <I>root</I>&nbsp; the focus node.
    Note that since <I>root</I>&nbsp; has no incoming arrows, its list of parent
    nodes is empty. In the Amplitudes box:
    <UL>
      <LI>
	In the row of state (0,1), insert 0.5 for the Real Part and 0.5 for the Imaginary
	Part.
      <LI>
	In the row of state (1,0), insert 0.707107 (i.e. 1/sqrt(2)) for the Real
	Part.
      <LI>
	All other entries of the Real and Imaginary Part columns should remain at
	their default values of zero.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    Make <I>nz+</I>&nbsp; the focus node.
    <UL>
      <LI>
	For <I>1mag</I>&nbsp; = (0,0) in the Parent Nodes box, make the following
	changes in the Amplitudes box. In the row of state 0, set the Real Part to
	1.
	<P>
	Explanation of last action: We are using the notation (n-, n+) to represent
	a state of <I>1mag</I> , where n- is the number of spin - particles and n+
	is the number of spin + particles. Node <I>nz+</I>&nbsp; has 2 states, 0
	and 1, where the numbers 0 and 1 tell how many particles of spin + go through
	node <I>nz+</I>&nbsp; . By setting to 1 the amplitude of <I>nz+</I>&nbsp;
	=0 when <I>1mag</I>&nbsp; = (0,0), what we are saying is that with unit
	amplitude, when <I>1mag</I>&nbsp; =(0,0), zero particles of spin + traverse
	node <I>nz+</I>&nbsp; .
      <LI>
	For <I>1mag</I>&nbsp; = (1,0) in the Parent Nodes box, make the following
	changes in the Amplitudes box. In the row of state 0, set the Real Part to
	1.
      <LI>
	For <I>1mag</I>&nbsp; = (0,1) in the Parent Nodes box, make the following
	changes in the Amplitudes box. In the row of state 1, set the Real Part to
	1.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    Make <I>nu+</I>&nbsp; the focus node.
    <UL>
      <LI>
	For <I>2mag</I>&nbsp; = (0,0) in the Parent Nodes box, make the following
	changes in the Amplitudes box. In the row of state 0, set the Real Part to
	1.
      <LI>
	For <I>2mag</I>&nbsp; =(1,0) in the Parent Nodes box, make the following
	changes in the Amplitudes box. In the row of state 0, set the Real Part to
	1.
      <LI>
	For <I>2mag</I>&nbsp; =(0,1) in the Parent Nodes box, make the following
	changes in the Amplitudes box. In the row of state 1, set the Real Part to
	1.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    Make <I>nz-</I>&nbsp; the focus node.
    <UL>
      <LI>
	For <I>1mag</I>&nbsp; = (0,0) in the Parent Nodes box, make the following
	changes in the Amplitudes box. In the row of state 0, set the Real Part to
	1.
      <LI>
	For <I>1mag</I>&nbsp; = (1,0) in the Parent Nodes box, make the following
	changes in the Amplitudes box. In the row of state 1, set the Real Part to
	1.
      <LI>
	For <I>1mag</I>&nbsp; = (0,1) in the Parent Nodes box, make the following
	changes in the Amplitudes box. In the row of state 0, set the Real Part to
	1.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    Make <I>nu-</I>&nbsp; the focus node.
    <UL>
      <LI>
	For <I>2mag</I>&nbsp; =(0,0) in the Parent Nodes box, make the following
	changes in the Amplitudes box. In the row of state 0, set the Real Part to
	1.
      <LI>
	For <I>2mag</I>&nbsp; =(1,0) in the Parent Nodes box, make the following
	changes in the Amplitudes box. In the row of state 1, set the Real Part to
	1.
      <LI>
	For <I>2mag</I>&nbsp; =(0,1) in the Parent Nodes box, make the following
	changes in the Amplitudes box. In the row of state 0, set the Real Part to
	1.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    Make <I>1mag</I>&nbsp; the focus node. Press the <B>Generate Amplitudes...</B>
    button at the bottom-right corner of the <B>Node Prior-Info.</B> window.
    A window entitled "Parameters Of Stern-Gerlach Magnet" will open.
    <UL>
      <LI>
	The Theta and Phi boxes at the top allow you to specify the polar coordinates
	of the magnetic field of the Stern-Gerlach Magnet. Set Theta and Phi to zero
	(their default value), indicating that the magnetic field points in the +
	Z direction.
      <LI>
	The Theta and Phi entries of the table allow you to specify the direction
	of the spin axis for the particles coming from <I>root</I>&nbsp; . Set both
	of these angles to zero (their default value), indicating that the particles
	emanating from <I>root</I>&nbsp; are polarized along the Z direction.
	<P>
	Press the <B>OK</B> button. Now scan over the 3 possible input states of
	<I>1mag</I>&nbsp; by pressing successively the <B>Next</B> button of the
	Parent Nodes box. You'll see that the Amplitudes box contains new amplitudes
	for each of the input states.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    Make <I>2mag</I>&nbsp; the focus node. Press the <B>Generate Amplitudes...</B>
    button at the bottom-right corner of the <B>Node Prior-Info.</B> window.
    A window entitled "Parameters Of Stern-Gerlach Magnet" will open.
    <UL>
      <LI>
	The Theta and Phi boxes at the top allow you to specify the polar coordinates
	of the magnetic field of the Stern-Gerlach Magnet. Set Theta to 36 degrees
	and Phi to zero degrees.
      <LI>
	The first row of the bottom table shows that <I>nz+</I>&nbsp; is a Parent
	Node. Click on the Spin entry of this row until it reads +. Set both Theta
	and Phi of this row to zero degrees.
      <LI>
	The second row of the bottom table shows that <I>nz-</I>&nbsp; is a Parent
	Node. Click on the Spin entry of this row until it reads -. Set both Theta
	and Phi of this row to zero degrees.
    </UL>
    <P>
    Press the <B>OK</B> button. Now scan over the 4 possible input states of
    <I>2mag</I>&nbsp; by pressing successively the <B>Next</B> button of the
    Parent Nodes box. You'll see that the Amplitudes box contains new amplitudes
    for each of the input states.
  <LI>
    Save your work by selecting the <B>Save</B> item of the <B>File</B> menu.
