    Choose <B>Preview</B> in the <B>Prepare</B> menu. This will open a window
    that will report the total probability of all stories. You will get a number
    that is very close to 1, provided that so far you've followed properly the
    instructions of this quick tour. If you do not get 1, the most likely explanation
    is that you entered the node matrices incorrectly. You'll have to go back
    and fix things. Press <B>OK</B> to dismiss the <B>Preview</B> window.
