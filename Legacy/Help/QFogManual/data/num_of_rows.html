This window opens if you press the <B>Number of Rows...</B> button of the
<B>Node Prior-Info.</B> window. It allows you to change the number of states
of the focus node of the <B>Node Prior-Info.</B> window. This number is the
same as the number of rows of the Amplitudes Table in that window. If you
ask for more rows, new rows are added to the END of the list of rows. If
you ask for fewer rows, rows are deleted from the END of the list of rows.
<P>
When you dismiss the above window by pressing <B>OK</B>, the number of rows
for the focus node becomes that specified in the window.
<P>
When you dismiss the above window by pressing <B>Cancel</B>, the number of
rows of the focus node&nbsp;remains the same as it was immediately before
you summoned the window.
