Choosing the item <B>Topology...</B> opens a Mac "file-designator"
window&mdash;a&nbsp;window that allows you to propose a name and location for
a&nbsp;new file. Suppose you use the file-designator window to&nbsp;submit
<CODE>AliceTopology </CODE>as the name of a new file. When you press the
<B>OK</B> button, Quantum Fog creates a TEXT file called
<CODE>AliceTopology</CODE>, and writes information into it. The information
characterizes the topology of the net being displayed at the moment in the
<B>Main Window</B>.
<P>
By choosing the items <B>Names Of Node States...</B> or <B>Amplitudes...</B>,
you can create TEXT files containing the names of the node states and the
amplitudes of the net.
<P>
IMP: If all nodes are unselected, and you press <B>Export/Names
Of Node States...</B>(ditto, <B>Export/Amplitudes...</B>), then
the TEXT file generated will contain a list of the names of the node states
(ditto, a list of the amplitudes of the nodes) for every node of the graph.
However, if some nodes are selected, then the file will contain this information
only for those nodes that are selected. This feature is convenient when you
want the file to show information for just a few, not all, of the nodes.
