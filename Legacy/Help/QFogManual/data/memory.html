<P>
If Quantum Fog complains that it's running out of memory, save all your open
projects, and quit Quantum Fog. This happened because you had one or more
large projects open at once. If you want to open the same projects again,
you should increase the memory allotted to Quantum Fog. This can be done
as follows. After quitting Quantum Fog, select its application icon (i.e.,
click once on it), and press the <B>Get Info</B> item of the <B>File </B>menu.
A window entitled "Quantum Fog Info" will open. In it, you'll find a box
entitled "Memory Requirements" which&nbsp;gives three memory sizes:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Suggested Size
  <LI>
    Minimum Size
  <LI>
    Preferred Size
</UL>
<P>
The Suggested Size is not editable but the other two are. We strongly suggest
that you do not change the Minimum Size. Increase the Preferred Size to whatever
you can afford on your computer.
