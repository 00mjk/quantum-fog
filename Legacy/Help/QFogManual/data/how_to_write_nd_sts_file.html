  How To Write A Names Of Node States File
</H1>
<P>
<BR>
A names of node states file (names file) is a TEXT file listing the names
of all the states of one or more nodes of a net.
<P>
As an example, consider a file called <CODE>my_node_states.txt</CODE>, that
contains the following:
<P>

<P>
This names file refers to a net with 3 or more nodes. Three of the nodes
of the net are: node A with states a1 and a2, node B with states b1 and b2,
and node C with states c1 and c2.

  <IMG BORDER="0" SRC="drum.gif" ><B>Pressing <B>Export/Names Of Node
  States...</B> in the <B>File</B> menu will produce a file that follows the
  format rules for a Quantum Fog names file. If no nodes are selected in the
  <B>Main Window</B>, the file will contain the state names of all the nodes
  of the net. If some nodes are selected, the file will contain the state names
  of only those nodes which are selected.</B>

<P>
Next we will state the general rules that one must follow in writing a names
file for Quantum Fog. Some of the terminology used below is defined in the
section entitled "Terminology-Alphabetic".
<P>
General Rules:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Everything from the beginning of the file up to the first hash character
    will be ignored. Hence, you may include a header in the file, as long as
    the header does not include any hash characters.
  <LI>
    You must include for each node whose state names you wish to specify:
    <UL>
      <LI>
	A first line consisting of: [hash symbol] [white-spaces] [RETURN].
      <LI>
	A second line consisting of: [node name] [white-spaces] [RETURN] The node
	name must be a Quantum Fog allowed name. It must already be the name of a
	node appearing in the <B>Main Window</B>.
      <LI>
	For each state of the node, a line consisting of: [state name] [white-spaces]
	[RETURN]. The state name must be a Quantum Fog allowed name.
    </UL>
</UL>
<P>
The order in which node names and state names are enumerated does not matter.
