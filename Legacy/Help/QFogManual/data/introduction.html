  What is Quantum Fog?
</H1>
<P>
Quantum Fog<SUP>TM</SUP> (US Patent 5787236) is a Mac application for modelling
physical situations that exhibit quantum mechanical behavior. It's a tool
for investigating and discussing quantum measurement problems graphically,
in terms of network diagrams called quantum Bayesian nets. It can calculate
one- and two-variable conditional probability distributions, and it can draw
a picture of every Feynman path that contributes to a physical situation.
It simulates a general purpose quantum computer.
<P>
Quantum Fog is NOT a Monte-Carlo simulation program. Its results are exact
(within machine precision).
<P>
Quantum Fog is NOT a wavefunction plotting package.
<P>
Quantum Fog does NOT espouse any particular interpretation of Quantum Mechanics.
It abides by rules that are common to all the mainstream interpretations.
<P>
You'll find Quantum Fog easy to understand and use, even if you have little
or no prior knowledge of Quantum Mechanics.
<P>
Quantum Fog can be used as:
<P>
<B>A teaching tool</B>. Students embarking on their first Quantum Mechanics
course will find that Quantum Fog greatly improves their understanding of
the subject. Quantum Mechanics teachers will find Quantum Fog a very effective
tool for explaining measurement theory.
<P>
<B>A research tool. </B>Despite its apparent simplicity, Quantum Fog is a
flexible, powerful, sophisticated program. Even advanced researchers will
find it useful.
