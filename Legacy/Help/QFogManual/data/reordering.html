  Reordering Items In A List
</H1>
<P>
The Reorder Icon <IMG SRC="reorder_icon.gif" >appears
at 3 different places within the <B>Node Prior-Info.</B> window.
<OL>
  <LI>
    Adjacent to the name of the focus node. Clicking here permits you to change
    the order in which nodes are listed in the popup menu directly above the
    Reorder Icon.
  <LI>
    On the top-right corner of the table inside the Parent Nodes box. Clicking
    here permits you to reorder the rows of this table.
  <LI>
    On the top-right corner of the table inside the Amplitudes box. Clicking
    here permits you to reorder the rows of this table.
</OL>
<P>
In all 3 cases, clicking on the Reorder Icon opens a similar dialog window.
Thus, we will only discuss the dialog for case 1:
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="Middle" SRC="reorder_nds.gif" >
<P>
This dialog lists the nodes of the Kindergarten Net considered in Part II
of this manual.
<P>
You can select an item of the list and then drag it to a new position.
<P>
If you press the <B>(a,b,c)</B> button, the list is ordered alphabetically.
<P>
When you dismiss the above window by pressing <B>OK</B>, the order of items
in the node popup becomes the same as that exhibited by the above window.
<P>
When you dismiss the above window by pressing <B>Cancel</B>, the order of
items in the node popup remains the same as it was immediately before you
summoned the above window.
<P>
<B>Tip:</B> Suppose you have a long list of numbers that you wish to order
numerically. Take the numbers 12, 7 and 1, for example. Not a long list,
but this is only for illustration purposes. The <B>(a,b,c)</B> button will
order this list thus 1, 12, 7 (alphabetically) instead of thus 1, 7, 12
(numerically). Note, however, that if you write your numbers with zero
placeholders: 01, 07, 12, then the <B>(a,b,c)</B> button can accomplish the
task of ordering the numbers numerically. Indeed, with zero placeholders,
the numeric and alphabetic orders are the same: 01, 07, 12.
