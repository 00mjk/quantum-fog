<P>
This command causes the computer to calculate node and bi-node probabilities
for one or more e-cases.
<P>
Which e-cases are analyzed when you press <B>Go Forward</B> once? It depends
on the current settings in the <B>Prepare</B> menu. If in the <B>Prepare</B>
menu:
<UL>
  <LI>
    an e-cases file has been designated, and
    <UL>
      <LI>
	the <B>Do One E-Case At A Time</B> option is ON, then, when you press <B>Go
	Forward</B>, the computer analyzes the next e-case in the e-cases file.
      <LI>
	the <B>Do One E-Case At A Time</B> option is OFF, then, when you press <B>Go
	Forward</B>, the computer analyzes all e-cases in the e-cases file.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    no e-cases file has been designated, then, when you press <B>Go Forward</B>,
    the computer analyzes the e-case specified in the <B>Node Prior-Info.</B>
    window.
</UL>
<P>
Immediately after pressing <B>Go Forward</B>, it becomes possible to open
the <B>Node Probs.</B> window.
<P>
If, prior to pressing <B>Go Forward</B>, at least one bi-node was selected
in the <B>Bi-nodes Of Interest</B> window, then, upon pressing <B>Go
Forward</B>, it becomes possible to open the <B>Bi-node Probs.</B> window.
<P>
If, prior to pressing <B>Go Forward</B>, the <B>Illustrate Stories</B> option
of the <B>Prepare</B> menu was ON, then, upon pressing <B>Go Forward</B>,
it becomes possible to open the <B>Stories</B> window.
<P>
If, prior to pressing <B>Go Forward</B>, a Node Probs. file (or a Bi-node
Probs. file, or a Stories file) is designated by means of the <B>TEXT Files
Used During Run...</B> window, then, upon pressing <B>Go Forward</B>, the
Node Probs. file (or Bi-node Probs. file, or Stories file) is filled with
data for the e-case or e-cases that the computer analyzes.
<P>
You can remind yourself of what e-case a given <B>Node Probs.</B> or <B>Bi-node
Probs.</B> or <B>Stories</B> window belongs to by looking at the top of <B>Main
Window's</B> pane. Quantum Fog displays there the name of the current e-case.
