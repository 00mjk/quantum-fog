Choosing either the item <B>Names Of Node States...</B> or the item
<B>Amplitudes...</B> opens a Mac "file-chooser" window&mdash;a window that allows
you to open an already existing TEXT file. If you select, say,
<CODE>file_1</CODE> in the file-chooser window, and then press its
<B>Open</B> button, Quantum Fog attempts to read <CODE>file_1</CODE>. If
Quantum Fog can do this successfully, it updates its data about the net with
the data in <CODE>file_1</CODE>.
<P>
If you started by choosing the <B>Names Of Node States...</B> item, Quantum
Fog assumes that you are opening a Names of Node States file. This is a TEXT
file that contains the names of the states for one or more nodes of the net.
See the section entitled "How To Write A Names Of Node States File".
<P>
If you started by choosing the <B>Amplitudes...</B> item, Quantum Fog assumes
that you are opening an Amplitudes file. This is a TEXT file that contains
the transition matrix for one or more nodes of the net. See the section entitled
"How To Write An Amplitudes File".
