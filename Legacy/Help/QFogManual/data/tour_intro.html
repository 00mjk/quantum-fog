Welcome to the Quick Tour section. It guides you step by step in the building
and running of a quantum net called <CODE>MyKindergartenNet</CODE>. In the
process of doing this, you will learn how to use the most important features
of Quantum Fog. Once you are finished building your Kindergarten Net, you
may want to compare it with ours. We've placed ours in the folder labeled
<CODE>KindergartenExample</CODE>.
