    Throughout this manual, when we say "...X1 (ditto, X2)...", we mean that
    everything we said about X1 applies also to X2.&nbsp;
  <DT>
    <A NAME="node"><I>node</I>&nbsp; </A>
  <DD>
    A bounded shape.

    are NOT draw by Quantum Fog, but it is occasionally useful to speak of them.
    See Ref. <A HREF="refs.html#Tuc95" >[Tuc95]</A> if interested.
    A net is considered the same, whether its external arrows are drawn or not.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="internal_node"> <I>internal node</I>&nbsp; </A>
  <DD>
    A node that has one or more outgoing internal arrows.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="external_node"> <I>external node</I>&nbsp; </A>
  <DD>
    A node that has no outgoing internal arrows.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="graph"> <I>graph</I>&nbsp; </A>
  <DD>
    A collection of nodes and arrows. In this manual, the arrows of our graphs
    are all internal ones.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="labeled_graph"> <I>labeled graph</I>&nbsp; </A>
  <DD>
    A graph in which each node has been assigned a name (label).
  <DT>
    <A NAME="cycle"> <I>cycle</I>&nbsp; </A>

    <A NAME="acyclic_graph"> <I>acyclic graph</I>&nbsp; </A>
  <DD>
    A graph that contains no cycles.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="root_node"> <I>root node</I>&nbsp; </A>
  <DD>
    A node with no incoming internal arrows. It corresponds to a "wave-function"
    in Quantum Mechanics.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="parent_node"> <I>parent nodes of node X</I>&nbsp; </A>
  <DD>
    Nodes connected to X by arrows that enter X.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="state_of_a_node"> <I>state of node X</I>&nbsp; </A>
  <DD>
    A state that X may assume.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="state_set"> <I>state set of node X</I>&nbsp; </A>
  <DD>
    The set of states that X may assume.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="degeneracy"> <I>degeneracy of node X</I>&nbsp; </A>
  <DD>

    </A>
  <DD>
    An assignment of a state to each of the parent nodes of node X.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="node_matrix"> <I>node matrix (transition matrix)</I>&nbsp; </A>
  <DD>
    A matrix assigned to a single node. The rows of the matrix are labeled by
    the states of the node and the columns by its input states.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="net"> <I>net (network)</I>&nbsp; </A>
  <DD>
    As in Ref. <A HREF="refs.html#Tuc95" >[Tuc95]</A>, we define
    a net to be an abstract construct comprising a graph and a node matrix for
    each node of the graph. The graph is labeled and acyclic. We define a
    <I>Classical Bayesian net</I>&nbsp; to be a net of the type used in
    Refs.<A HREF="refs.html" >1-3</A>&nbsp;&mdash;a net such that
    the entries of its node matrices are non-negative real numbers. We define
    a <I>Quantum Bayesian net</I>&nbsp; to be a net of the type used in
    Ref.<A HREF="refs.html#Tuc95" >[Tuc95]</A>&mdash; a net such that
    the entries of its node matrices are complex numbers. In this manual, unless
    stated otherwise, when we speak simply of a net, we mean a Quantum Bayesian
    one.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="node_amplitude"> <I>node amplitude (transition amplitude)</I>&nbsp;
    &nbsp;</A>
  <DD>
    An entry of a node matrix of a Quantum Bayesian net.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="story"> <I>story (graph instantiation)</I> </A>
  <DD>
    An assignment of a state to each node of the graph. Stories correspond to
    what the Quantum Mechanics literature calls Feynman paths. Unlike the term
    "story", the term "path" feels awkward to us when speaking about a system
    of more than one particle. Whenever possible, we will use the term "story
    " instead of "path".
  <DT>
    <A NAME="ending"> <I>ending</I>&nbsp; </A>
  <DD>
    An assignment of a state to each of the external nodes of a graph. An ending
    is part of a story.
  <DT>
    <I><A NAME="conditional_probability">conditional probability P(H|E)</A></I>
  <DD>
    The probability that H occurs, <I>conditioned on</I> &nbsp;the fact (i.e.,
    assuming that) E occurs. H is often called the hypothesis and E the evidence
    or condition or data.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="active_state"> <I>active state</I>&nbsp; </A>
  <DD>
    A state is active in a physical experiment if the experimenter has determined
    by prior measurement (or can determine if he tries) that the state can occur
    during the experiment. Quantum Fog calculates conditional probability
    distributions for nodes and bi-nodes, the evidence for the conditional
    probabilities being which states of each node are active.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="active_state_list"> <I>active state list (set) of node X</I>&nbsp;
    &nbsp;</A>
  <DD>
    The set of states of node X that are active.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="default_active_state_list"> <I>default active state list</I>&nbsp;
    &nbsp;</A>
  <DD>
    An active state list that is as full as possible&mdash;it contains ALL the states
    of the node.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="e-case"> <I>evidence case (e-case)</I>&nbsp; </A>
  <DD>
    An assignment of an active state set to each node of the graph.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="story_amplitude"> <I>story amplitude (net amplitude)</I>&nbsp; </A>
  <DD>
    A story 's amplitude is calculated as follows. A story determines a unique
    transition amplitude A<SUB>i</SUB> for each node. How? For the i'th&nbsp;node,
    choose as A<SUB>i</SUB> the element of its transition matrix with (row, column)
    = (its state, its input state). Only one such row-column pair is consistent
    with the story. The story amplitude is defined as the product
    A<SUB>1</SUB>*A<SUB>2</SUB>*...A<SUB>N</SUB>, where N is the number of nodes.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="possible_story"> <I>possible story</I>&nbsp; </A>
  <DD>
    A story that assigns active states to all nodes of the graph, and that has
    a non-zero amplitude.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="feynman_integral"> <I>Feynman Integral</I>&nbsp; </A>
  <DD>
    The Feynman Integral FI(e) for the ending e is the sum of the complex amplitudes
    of all possible stories with ending e. In general, FI(e) depends on which
    states of each node are active.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="total_prob"> <I>total probability of all stories</I>&nbsp; </A>
  <DD>
    The sum over all e of |FI(e)|<SUP>2</SUP>, assuming that all node states
    are active, where FI(e) is the Feynman Integral corresponding to the ending
    e. This probability should be 1.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="det_node"> <I>deterministic node</I>&nbsp; </A>
  <DD>
    A node for which the input state uniquely determines the state of the node.
    For each input state, only one state of the node has a non-zero amplitude.
  <DT>
    <I><A NAME="entropy">entropy</A></I>&nbsp;
  <DD>
    Given a classical probability distribution p<SUB>1</SUB>, p<SUB>2</SUB>,
    ..., p<SUB>D</SUB>, its Entropy S is the following number :
    <P>
    <P>
    S = -[p<SUB>1</SUB> log<SUB>2</SUB>(p<SUB>1</SUB>) &nbsp; + p<SUB>2</SUB>
    log<SUB>2</SUB>(p<SUB>2</SUB>) + ... + p<SUB>D</SUB>
    log<SUB>2</SUB>(p<SUB>D</SUB>)].
    <P>
    <P>
    For example, if all p<SUB>i</SUB> are equal to 1/D, this gives
    S=log<SUB>2</SUB>(D). D is the number of states or degeneracy of the
    distribution. If D = 2<SUP>B</SUP> (B is referred to as the number of bits),
    then S = B.
    <P>
    <P>
    As another example, suppose that one p<SUB>i</SUB> equals one and all others
    equal zero. Then, S=0 (because log1=0, &nbsp;and xlog(x) tends to 0 as x
    tends to 0 with x&gt;0.)
    <P>
    <P>
    In general, one can show that 0&lt;= S &lt;= log<SUB>2</SUB>(D) so the two
    examples just given represent the two extremes.
    <P>
    <P>
    You can think of S as measuring the spread (dispersion) of the distribution.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="text_file"><I>TEXT file</I>&nbsp; </A>
  <DD>
    A data file in a special format. Most word processors and spreadsheets allow
    you to save a file in this format. We recommend that you use TextWrangler,
    a free application, to deal with all TEXT files associated with Quantum
    Fog.&nbsp;
  <DT>
  <DD>
    Quantum Fog uses&nbsp;TEXT files for both reading and writing data; specifically,
    it reads and writes TEXT files with UNIX line endings (TextWrangler allows
    you to save TEXT files with either UNIX, Mac Classic, or Windows line endings).
  <DT>
  <DD>
    TEXT files generated by Quantum Fog should be viewed in a fixed-width font
    like Monaco or Courier. Otherwise, columns will not line up properly.
    Alternatively, you can open the file with a spreadsheet application. This
    way, you can use the powerful features of the spreadsheet to manipulate the
    data. When reading a TEXT file, spreadsheets will jump to the cell in the
    next column and the same row when they see a tab, and to the first cell in
    the next row when they see an end-of-line. TEXT files created by Quantum
    Fog are formatted with this convention in mind.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="white_space"><I>white-space</I>&nbsp; </A>
  <DD>
    Result of pressing the space-bar, RETURN or TAB keys.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="description"> <I>[description of something]</I>&nbsp; </A>
  <DD>
    A symbol that should be replaced by whatever is described inside the square
    brackets. In particular, <I>[white-spaces]</I>&nbsp; means one or more
    white-spaces.
  <DT>
    <A NAME="Quantum_Fog_name"><I>Quantum Fog allowed name</I>&nbsp; </A>
  <DD>
    A string of no more than 31 characters and such that none of those characters
    is the hash character (#) or a white-space.

<H3>What Next...</H3>
<P>
Some of the above definitions may not make sense to you the first time you
read them. Don't worry. You'll understand them better as you learn more about
Quantum Fog.
<P>
Congratulations! You've just endured one of the hardest parts of this manual.
And now for a fun part.
<P>
We suggest that next you read the section entitled "Quick Tour".
