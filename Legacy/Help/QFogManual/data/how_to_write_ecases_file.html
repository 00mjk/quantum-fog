  How To Write An E-Cases File
</H1>
<P>
An e-cases file is a TEXT file listing several e-cases. Using an e-cases
file is recommended if you wish to study many e-cases of the same net.
<P>
As an example, consider a file called <CODE>my_Ecases.txt</CODE>, that contains
the following:
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="Middle" SRC="example,e_cases_file.gif" > <BR>
<P>
In this example, 3 e-cases are given.
<UL>
  <LI>
    For the first e-case, called "case_1", all nodes of the graph have a default
    active state list.
  <LI>
    For the second e-case, called "case_2", all nodes of the graph have a default
    active state list except for the node called "month". All the states of "month"
    are inactive except for the states called "april" and "may" .
  <LI>
    For the third e-case, called "case_3", all nodes of the graph have a default
    active state list except for the nodes called "month" and "day". All the
    states of "month" are inactive except for the states called "april", "may"
    and "august". All the states of "day" are inactive except for the states
    called "monday" and "tuesday" .
</UL>
<P>
Next we will state the general rules that one must follow in writing an e-cases
file for Quantum Fog. Some of the terminology used below is defined in the
section entitled "Terminology-Alphabetic".
<P>
General Rules:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Everything from the beginning of the file up to the first hash character
    will be ignored. Hence, you may include a header in the file, as long as
    the header does not include any hash characters.
  <LI>
    You must include for each e-case:
    <UL>
      <LI>
	A first line consisting of: [hash symbol] [white-spaces] [RETURN].
      <LI>
	A second line consisting of: [e-case name] [white-spaces] [RETURN] The e-case
	name must be a Quantum Fog allowed name.
      <LI>
	For each node that doesn't have a default active state list, a line consisting
	of: [node name] [white-spaces] [name of active state] [white-spaces] [name
	of another active state] [white-spaces] [name of another active
	state]...[white-spaces] [RETURN].
    </UL>
</UL>
<P>
The order in which node names, and state names are enumerated does not matter.
