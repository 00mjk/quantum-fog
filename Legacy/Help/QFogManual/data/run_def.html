  Quantum Fog "Run"
</H1>
<P>
<BR>
A Quantum Fog Run is a session of Quantum Fog during which one or more e-cases
are analyzed sequentially.
<P>
In a single-e-case run, you specify the single e-case via the <B>Node
Prior-Info.</B> window.
<P>
In a many-e-cases run, you specify several e-cases via an e-cases file. The
name of the e-cases file is entered into Quantum Fog via the window that
opens when one chooses the item: <B>TEXT Files Used During Run...</B> in
the <B>Prepare</B> menu.
<P>
When Quantum Fog is at the beginning of a run, before having analyzed any
e-cases, we say that Quantum Fog is in its <I>initial run-state</I>. Likewise,
after finishing with one e-case of an e-cases file, but before beginning
a new one, we say that Quantum Fog is in an <I>intermediate run-sate</I>.
Immediately after finishing the last e-case, we say that Quantum Fog is in
its <I>final run-state</I>.
<P>
Note how the last three menus of Quantum Fog depend on the current run-state:
<P>
  <HR>
<H3>Prepare Menu</H3><IMG ALIGN="Middle" SRC="menu,run_preps.gif" >
<P>
All of the items in this menu are disabled (dimmed) if the program is not
in the initial run-state. That's because these menu items deal with choices
that you must make at the beginning of a run.
<P>
  <HR>
<H3>Go Menu</B></H3>
<IMG ALIGN="Middle" SRC="menu,change_run_state.gif" >
<P>
Pressing <B>Go Back To Initial State</B> transfers the program from an
intermediate or the final run-state to the initial one.
<P>
Pressing <B>Go Forward</B> advances the program to the next run-state&mdash;either
an intermediate or the final one. 
  <HR>
<H3>Windows Menu</B></H3>
<IMG ALIGN="Middle" SRC="menu,windows.gif" >
<P>
The windows in this menu are grouped according to when they can be opened:
<P>
Can be opened at any time:
<UL>
  <LI>
    <B>Main Window</B>
  <LI>
    <B>Palette</B>
</UL>
<P>
Can be opened only in the initial run-state:
<UL>
  <LI>
    <B>Node Prior-Info.</B>
  <LI>
    <B>Bi-nodes Of Interest</B>
</UL>
<P>
Can be opened only in intermediate or final run-states:
<UL>
  <LI>
    <B>Node Probs.</B>
  <LI>
    <B>Bi-node Probs.</B>
  <LI>
    <B>Stories</B>
</UL>
<P>
All <B>Palette</B> items are enabled in the initial run-state. But some
<B>Palette</B> items are disabled in the intermediate and final states. In
those run-states, Quantum Fog disables those <B>Palette</B> items that would
allow you to add new nodes, or to tamper with the transition amplitudes of
already existing nodes.
