  <LI>
    Double click on the Quantum Fog application icon.
  <LI>
    Select the <B>Custom Node</B> icon in the <B>Palette</B>. Click once anywhere
    on the <B>Main Window</B>.
  <LI>
    Change the name of this new node to whatever you want.
  <LI>
    Color the node as follows. In the <B>Palette</B>, and double-click the rectangle
    (we'll call it a "color swatch") next to the paint brush icon. Choose a color
    from the ensuing dialog. The color that you choose will appear in the swatch
    of the <B>Palette</B> window. If now you select the <B>Paint</B> icon in
    the <B>Palette</B> and then touch a Custom or Deterministic Node, the node
    will take on the same color as that of the palette's swatch.
  <LI>
    Create a second Custom Node on the <B>Main Window</B>. Select the <B>Draw
    Arrow</B> icon in the <B>Palette</B>. Draw an arrow by dragging the bow and
    arrow cursor from the first to the second node.
  <LI>
    Select the <B>Select</B> icon in the <B>Palette</B>. Click on a node. It's
    now selected. Click on it again. It's now unselected. Click on an arrow.
    Click on it again.
  <LI>
    Select a node. Select the <B>Drag</B> icon in the <B>Palette</B>. Place the
    cursor over the selected node. Press the mouse button down, and, while holding
    the button down, move the cursor.
  <LI>
    Select a node. Press the DELETE key.
  <LI>
    Create other nodes of types: &nbsp;Beam-Splitter, Deterministic Node,
    Polarization Rotator, Polarizer, Qbit Rotator, Stern-Gerlach (S.G.) Magnet.
    Draw more arrows. Continue to experiment with the <B>Select</B> and
    <B>Drag</B> tools and with the DELETE key.
  <LI>
    Choose <B>Select All</B> from the <B>Edit</B> menu. Press the DELETE key.
  <LI>
    Copy the following diagram. Use the same node labels and node
    types.<IMG ALIGN="Middle" SRC="tour_net.gif" >
  <LI>
    Use the <B>Save As...</B> item of the <B>File</B> menu to save your copy
    of the above diagram. Call the new document <CODE>MyKindergartenNet</CODE>.
  <LI>
    Close the <B>Palette</B>. The cursor is now a "pointer"&mdash;a boldface arrow
    pointing towards the top-left corner of the screen. Click on a node, and,
    while holding the button down, move the cursor. Click somewhere on the <B>Main
    Window</B> away from the nodes or arrows. You will find that this cursor
    performs the 3 functions of select, drag and open that you have come to associate
    with such a cursor, in drawing applications like MacDraw.
